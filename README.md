# A Simple Static Website with Tailwind CSS

## This is a simple landing page company website that created with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Javascript

The website is responsive, at least it fits mobile, tablet, and desktop view. Here's what I've done:

* Create an NPM folder
* Download Tailwind CSS via NPM
* Set the Tailwind config file
* Build the website and make it responsive
* Runt the website on my local server via node.js
